### Overview

Disgo is the main client / node for the Dispatch platform. It initializes all of the services. The services are from the other packages in this repository.  The approach is to have several smaller "building block" modules that are usable components of common blockchain architectures. Our intention is to facilitate a buildable blockchain so that can be used individually so that other projects don't have to start from scratch.

### Download

With Go installed, enter either of the following commands into your terminal:

`go get github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo`  
or  
`git clone http://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo` (into your GOPATH)

If you have yet to install Go, visit our [tutorial](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/samples/tree/master/golang-setup) or download straight from the [Golang website.](https://golang.org/dl/)

go run main.go
```
