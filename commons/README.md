### Overview

The Disgo folder 'Commons' contains the common code that is present in every Disgo component.   All projects in the repository depend on Commons. The current items living here are:

 - Structures, Interfaces, and Services that are used all throughout the system
 - Particularly any dependent files that would result in circular dependencies otherwise.
 - Files with common utility functions

### Download

With Go installed, enter either of the following commands into your terminal:

`go get github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/commons`
or  
`git clone http://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/commons`

If you have yet to install Go, visit the [tutorial](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/samples/tree/master/golang-setup) or download straight from the [Golang website.](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Wiki Documentation
Technical details of Commons and its inner workings are available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo_commons/wiki) page. Here is a shortcut list of helpful topics:

 - [How to use the common config structure](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/wiki/Config)
 - [What is the IService interface](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/commons/wiki#iservice-interface)
 - [Details of the crypo package](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/commons/wiki#crypto)

### Dependencies

The significant dependency for Commons is the C crypto libraries we are using.  At the moment, it is necessary to have gcc installed to use the crypto features.  We are in the process of creating platform specific binaries so that additional installs are not necessary.

### Configuration
Commons contains the configuration struct that a client using the system needs for setting up system properties. 

Any custom node bootstrap implementation should load the appropriate properties into this structure for the components that are used.  For a concrete example, see how it is done in our [disgo node.]()

The details of the configuration setup can be viewed [here in the wiki.](https://github.com/dispatchlabs/disgo/wiki/Config)
